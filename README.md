# Group 7 WeatherModel
Group 7 weather model project: A repository for developing and deploying a weather prediction model using a weather dataset for Gulu. this project aims to predict precipitation patterns base on otrher features. the repository will contain code, data, and documentation for the project.

# members contribution 
This work was collectively done by each member of group 7 and everyone has the following roles to play:

Nyeko Francis did the notebook documentation,model evaulation with additional metrics, and it insight

Richard Sserubombwe did dataset research and selection

Nakitto Moureen did data cleaning and processing

Apolot Miria did Scatter Plot (updated from Map as dataset lacks geo-variation)

David Sanyu did Bubble Plot (updated from Map)

Namubiru Winfred did the Choropleth Plot (updated to heatmap as no geo data) and Insights and Interpretation

#Description
This project utilizes a weather dataset for Gulu, Uganda, analyzing temperature, precipitation, and other weather patterns. The goal is to provide insights into Gulu's climate trends and predictions.

Features
